- title: "Exoskeleton-Covered Soft Finger with Vision-Based Proprioception and Tactile Sensing"
  image: 
  description: We develop a novel exoskeleton-covered soft finger with
    embedded cameras and deep learning methods that enable high-resolution
    To do so, we design features along the axial direction of the finger,
    which enable high-resolution proprioceptive sensing, and incorporate a
    reflective ink coating on the surface of the finger to enable rich
    tactile sensing proprioceptive sensing and rich tactile sensing.

- title: "Soft, Round, High Resolution Tactile Fingertip Sensors for Dexterous Robotic Manipulation"
  image: 
  description: High resolution optical based sensors such as GelSight have until now
   been constrained to relatively flat geometries due to constraints on
   illumination geometry.Here, we show how to construct a rounded fingertip
   that utilizes a form of light piping for directional illumination.
