# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand tactile sensing and its
role in robotic manipulation.
To do so, we use and develop novel
visual-tactile sensors.

Questions of interest include: (i), How do we as humans perceive our
environment using tactile sensing?
(ii), how do we fuse that data with vision?
